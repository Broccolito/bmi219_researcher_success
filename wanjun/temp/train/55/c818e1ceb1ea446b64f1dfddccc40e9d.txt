Ten things you should know about transposable elements; SIRT6 promotes DNA repair under stress by activating PARP1; High-molecular-mass hyaluronan mediates the cancer resistance of the naked mole rat; Comparison of nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination in human cells; DNA repair by nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination during cell cycle in human cells; L1 drives IFN in senescent cells and promotes age-associated inflammation; Hypersensitivity to contact inhibition provides a clue to cancer resistance of naked mole-rat; Changes in DNA repair during aging; SIRT6 represses LINE1 retrotransposons by ribosylating KAP1 but this repression fails with stress and age; Non-homologous DNA end joining in plant cells is associated with deletions and filler DNA insertions; Establishing primary adult fibroblast cultures from rodents; Expression of human telomerase (hTERT) does not prevent stress-induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts but protects the cells from stress-induced apoptosis and necrosis; DNA end joining becomes less efficient and more error-prone during cellular senescence; LINE1 derepression in aged wild-type and SIRT6-deficient mice drives inflammation; How plants make ends meet: DNA double-strand break repair; ATRX loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining DNA repair in glioma; Telomerase activity coevolves with body mass not lifespan; Mechanisms of cancer resistance in long-lived mammals; Comparative genetics of longevity and cancer: insights from long-lived rodents; Change of the death pathway in senescent human fibroblasts in response to DNA damage is caused by an inability to stabilize p53
